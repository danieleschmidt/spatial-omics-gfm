# Spatial-Omics GFM Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Spatial-Omics Graph Foundation Model (GFM)  
**Project Code**: SPATIAL-GFM  
**Charter Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Charter Version**: 1.0  
**Project Manager**: Daniel Schmidt  
**Executive Sponsor**: TBD

## Problem Statement

Spatial transcriptomics technologies generate unprecedented amounts of data capturing gene expression with precise spatial coordinates, but current analysis methods fail to leverage the full potential of this spatial information. Existing approaches treat spatial data as independent measurements or apply simplistic neighborhood analyses, missing complex multi-scale tissue organization patterns and cell-cell communication networks.

Key limitations of current methods:
- **Limited Scalability**: Cannot handle population-scale datasets (>1M cells)
- **Poor Spatial Modeling**: Ignore complex spatial relationships and tissue architecture
- **Task-Specific Solutions**: Separate tools for different analyses, preventing integrated understanding
- **No Transfer Learning**: Each analysis starts from scratch, wasting computational resources
- **Interpretation Challenges**: Results lack biological context and mechanistic insights

## Vision Statement

**"Enable breakthrough discoveries in spatial biology by building the world's first billion-parameter Graph Foundation Model that understands tissue organization, predicts cell-cell interactions, and transfers knowledge across tissues, species, and platforms."**
