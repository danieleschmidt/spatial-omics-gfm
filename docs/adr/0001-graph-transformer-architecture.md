# ADR-0001: Graph Transformer Architecture Choice

**Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Daniel Schmidt, Spatial-Omics Team

## Context

Spatial transcriptomics data represents gene expression measurements with precise spatial coordinates, creating a natural graph structure where cells are nodes and spatial proximity defines edges. We need to choose an architecture that can:

1. Handle billion-parameter scale models for comprehensive biological understanding
2. Effectively model spatial relationships between cells
3. Support multiple downstream tasks (cell typing, interaction prediction, pathway analysis)
4. Scale to population-level datasets with millions of cells
5. Integrate with existing spatial omics toolkits (Scanpy, Squidpy)

Key technical constraints:
- Graph structure varies significantly between platforms (Visium: ~3000 spots, Xenium: ~1M cells)
- Spatial relationships are critical for biological interpretation
- Need both local and global context for accurate predictions
- Memory efficiency required for large-scale deployment

## Decision

We will implement a **Spatial Graph Transformer** architecture with the following characteristics:

### Core Architecture
- **Base Model**: Graph Transformer with 24 layers, 16 attention heads, 1024 hidden dimensions
- **Spatial Encoding**: Learned positional embeddings for 2D/3D coordinates
- **Attention Mechanism**: Distance-aware attention with spatial bias terms
- **Message Passing**: Edge-featured graph convolutions integrated with self-attention

### Key Components
1. **Gene Expression Encoder**: Linear projection from gene space to hidden dimensions
2. **Spatial Position Encoder**: Sinusoidal + learned embeddings for coordinates
3. **Graph Transformer Layers**: Self-attention + cross-attention with spatial neighbors
4. **Task-Specific Heads**: Modular design for different prediction tasks

### Technical Specifications
```python
class SpatialGraphTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.gene_encoder = nn.Linear(n_genes, hidden_dim)
        self.spatial_encoder = SpatialPositionEncoding()
        self.transformer_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            SpatialTransformerLayer() for _ in range(24)
        ])
        self.task_heads = nn.ModuleDict({
            'cell_type': CellTypeHead(),
            'interactions': InteractionHead(),
            'pathways': PathwayHead()
        })
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Transformer architecture scales well to billion-parameter models
- **Flexibility**: Attention mechanism naturally handles variable graph structures
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific tissues/tasks
- **Interpretability**: Attention weights provide biological insights into cell-cell interactions
- **Multi-task Learning**: Single model can handle multiple prediction tasks simultaneously

### Negative
- **Computational Cost**: Quadratic complexity in number of cells for full attention
- **Memory Requirements**: Large models require significant GPU memory
- **Training Complexity**: Distributed training required for largest models
- **Cold Start**: Requires substantial training data for optimal performance

### Mitigations
- **Sparse Attention**: Limit attention to spatial neighbors to reduce complexity
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Trade computation for memory during training
- **Mixed Precision**: Use fp16/bf16 to reduce memory footprint
- **Progressive Training**: Start with smaller models and scale up

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
- **Pros**: Simpler architecture, faster training, well-established in spatial omics
- **Cons**: Limited receptive field, poor scalability to large graphs, less expressive
- **Verdict**: Rejected due to scalability limitations for billion-parameter models

### 2. Standard Transformer (no graph structure)
- **Pros**: Mature architecture, extensive tooling, proven scalability
- **Cons**: Ignores spatial relationships, poor inductive bias for graph data
- **Verdict**: Rejected as spatial structure is critical for biological interpretation

### 3. GraphSAINT/FastGCN Sampling-based Approaches
- **Pros**: Better scalability than vanilla GCNs, maintains graph structure
- **Cons**: Sampling introduces noise, limited to smaller models, complex training
- **Verdict**: Rejected due to billion-parameter requirement and sampling artifacts

### 4. Vision Transformer on Spatial Images
- **Pros**: Proven architecture for spatial data, excellent scalability
- **Cons**: Loses single-cell resolution, poor handling of irregular spatial distributions
- **Verdict**: Rejected due to resolution requirements for cell-level analysis
